This repository includes the necessary files required to analyze acquired in vivo and ex vivo
extracellular field data, including example data and outcomes at all stages of the analysis protocol. 

example data and outcomes [can be downloaded here:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1brujKaQmTLo7rw-BgPGWlOZ5_E5DU4KH?usp=sharing) 

Python version tested: 3.8.8 
Python IDE tested: Spyder 4.2.1 
MATLAB version tested: R2019b, R2021b

Python dependencies: 

	numpy 
	pandas 
	scipy 

Non-standard hardware required? No 

Typical install time on a "normal" windows computer: plug and play MATLAB and Python code. No install time. 

Tested on a Dell XPS 15 running Windows 10 Home: 

	Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz   2.60 GHz 
	RAM - 16.0 GB (15.9 GB usable) 
	System type - 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor 
Tested on a Lenovo ThinkCentre running Windows 10 Enterprise: 

	Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7600T CPU @ 2.80 GHz   2.81GHz  
	RAM - 16.0 GB (15.9 GB usable) 
	System type - 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor 

Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer: 5-10 minutes including all steps

# ----- Standard Operating Procedure ------------- 

1. Export LFP data from LabChart File 
   (example exported LabChart data included in zipped folder with submission) 

2. Process exported LFP data in MatWAND. Export processed power area data for 
   post-processing in Python 

	a. 	See [MAtWAND](https://pantelisantonoudiou.github.io/MatWAND/) for installation and general 
		operation instructions. See [spectral analysis doc](/docs/spectral_analysis_processing.md) for 
  	     	manuscript-specific MatWAND operation instructions.  

	b. 	See provided zipped file with submission for expected outcomes for sample data.    

3. Organize exported power area data in Python 

	a. 	See [organize_power](/organize_power) folder for experiment-specific analysis scripts 

	b. 	See [organize power doc](/docs/organize_power_data.md) for Python script operation instructions. 

	c. 	See [organize power doc](/docs/organize_power_data.md) for export instructions for analysis in GraphPad Prism 

4. Organize and analyze processed MatWAND data for distribution analysis in MATLAB 

	a. 	See [main.m](/tail_analysis/main.m) for analysis script with included instructions
